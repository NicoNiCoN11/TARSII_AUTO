# TARSII_AUTO
A method to predict the DMRs of genome of mammals efficiently

Another auto-product since the last one was published, and in this TARSII_Auto which is based on the TARSII developed by Zhangyi's lab, 
Here, we design a script that can make commands to the TARSII automatically, what we need to do is giving it the path to the raw data and path to the output data
This script can also catagories each file based on the file name and make different folders to make them more clear

Still developping.....
